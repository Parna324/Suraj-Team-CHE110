                <h2>Soil Erosion</h2>
                <p>Soil erosion is a natural process that involves the removal of the top layer of soil by various
                    agents such as water, wind, ice, or human activities. This process can have significant
                    environmental and agricultural consequences.</p>

                <h2>Effects</h2>
                <p>Soil erosion depletes fertile topsoil, reducing agricultural productivity, disrupting ecosystems, and
                    increasing the risk of landslides. It also contributes to sedimentation in water bodies, impairing
                    water quality and affecting aquatic habitats..</p>

    <div class="types" id="Types">
        <div class="paragraph-box">
            <h2>Sheet Erosion:
            </h2>
            <p> Thin layers of soil are gradually removed from large expanses of land, often as a result of
                rainfall and surface water flow.
                Mechanism: Water flows evenly over the surface, carrying away a uniform layer of soil.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph-box">
            <h2>Rill Erosion</h2>
            <p> The development of small channels or grooves on the surface of the soil, usually caused by
                the concentration of water flow.
                Mechanism: Water accumulates in small channels, creating noticeable depressions in the landscape.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-box">
            <h2>Gully Erosion</h2>
            <p>Deeper and larger channels than rills, gullies are formed when concentrated water flow increases, leading
                to the development of more substantial channels.
                Mechanism: Continuous water flow deepens and widens the channels, causing more significant soil loss.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-box">
            <h2>Wind Erosion</h2>
            <p> Soil particles are lifted and transported by the wind, leading to the removal of the topsoil layer.
                Mechanism: Strong winds detach and carry loose soil particles, impacting exposed surfaces.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-box">
            <h2>Landslide Erosion</h2>
            <p>Rapid downslope movement of a large mass of soil, rocks, and debris.
                Mechanism: Gravity, often triggered by factors like heavy rainfall, earthquakes, or human activities,
                causes a sudden and intense movement of material downslope.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-box">
            <h2>Bank Erosion</h2>
            <p> Erosion occurring along riverbanks or coastal areas due to the action of flowing water or waves.
                Mechanism: The force of water or waves undermines the stability of the bank, leading to its collapse and
                soil loss.
                .

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-box">
            <h2>Tunnel Erosion</h2>
            <p>The creation of tunnels or pipes within the soil, typically in areas with sandy soils.
                Mechanism: Water flowing through the soil forms tunnels by carrying away finer particles, leaving behind
                coarser materials.


            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-box">
            <h2>Streambank Erosion</h2>
            <p>: The wearing away of stream or riverbanks by the force of flowing water.
                Mechanism: Water flow weakens and erodes the bank, leading to the removal of soil and sediment.
